Using pyinstaller:

Set up a virtual environment (if not already done for the project) and activate it
conda create --name my_env python=3
activate my_env

Then pip install pyinstaller and any dependencies of the program.
Need to check what the imports are and install any third party ones
pip install pyinstaller package1 package2...
* Seems like pip installing creates smaller distribution packages

Then run pyinstaller using one of the two options below:

1) Bundling to one folder
pyinstaller myscript.py

2 Bundling to one file
pyinstaller --onefile myscript.py
