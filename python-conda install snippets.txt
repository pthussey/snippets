miniconda install

1) Install miniconda
* If do not add to PATH then need to go in to environment variables and add (change to my user path):
C:\Users\usr\miniconda3
C:\Users\usr\miniconda3\Scripts
C:\Users\usr\miniconda3\Library\bin

2) Activate the base environment and install the main packages I use:
conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
* dependency packages like numpy also get installed with these
* see the virtual environment snippets for details on how to install Jupyter notebook
