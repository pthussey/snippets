miniconda install

1) Install miniconda
* If do not add to PATH then need to go in to environment variables and add (change to my user path):
C:\Users\usr\miniconda3
C:\Users\usr\miniconda3\Scripts
C:\Users\usr\miniconda3\Library\bin
* Check "App execution aliases" in the Windows search box and make sure the two Python related ones are switched off
  If this is not done python will not run from the command line and the Windows app store will open instead

2) Activate the base environment by entering "activate base" at the command prompt and install the main packages I use:
conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
* dependency packages like numpy also get installed with these
* see the virtual environment snippets for details on how to install Jupyter notebook
* if using PowerShell and activate base doesn't work then need to do the following:
1. Open Powershell and browse to condabin folder in your conda installation directory, for example: C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\condabin
2. Run ./conda init powershell in that folder, and re-open the powershell.
3. Please note: If you encountered ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system, simply run the Powershell as Administrator and enter the following: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
4. Restart the Powershell & Enjoy!
