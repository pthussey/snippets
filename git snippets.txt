How to clone one of my repositories so I can work on it on multiple machines
Cloning one of my own repositories from github to a different machine allows me to work on it from multiple machines.
Before working on it though I need to pull(?) other changes over to the machine I will work on to keep things in sync.
Steps in GitHub Desktop:
1. Go to File - Clone a repository
2. Choose the folder in Local Path
   * Do not add a new folder to the path because a new folder with the repo name will be created.
3. Choose the repository from Your Repositories
4. Click Clone

To initialize a new repository
Navigate to the folder for the project and use:
git init

To create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞

To switch to a branch
git checkout ＜branchname＞

To merge a branch back into main
* I did it once via pull request using GitHub Desktop
* Using pull request works and I read that it is a good practice even though I'm programming by myself
* Next time I do this make notes on it
